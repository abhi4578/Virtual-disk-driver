# How to MAKE IT WORK
Make sure Makefile,all C files are in same directory
Type the following command in terminal to get the driver and virtual hard disk working  :
make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD - this leads to creation of .ko(dor.ko) and .o(dor.o) files.

sudo insmod ./dor.ko - inserts module into kernal and creates /dev/rb block device file for VHD

use cat to write/read into the /dev/rb

See the syslog for better understanding of working of driver using command: tail -f /var/log/syslog

To check if device has been registered or the mjor number of device using command : cat /proc/devices

Format the VHD into vfat file system using command: mkfs.vfat /dev/rb

mount the formatted VHD filesystem : mount -t vfat /dev/rb  "any location you want to mount eg: /mnt/"

umount "the location of mounting" - unmounts the VHD

sudo rmmod dor.ko - removes the module from kernal.
